## disk-encryption-hetzner

This should be a clean step-by-step guide how to setup a hetzner root server from the server auctions at hetzners "serverb√∂rse" to get a fully encrypted software raid1 with lvm on top.

The goal of this guide is to have a server system that has encrypted drives and is remotely unlockable.

This guide *could* work at any other provider with a rescue system.
